I'm not sure how the hell this thing works yet. --philip

Corey here: What I've added is a jQuery-formatted version, along with folders for stuff. I'm still kinda lost too, but it's progress, right? Also, Dr. Moshell has confirmed that our "show and tell" is on the 28th, with the project being graded over the following weekend.

login now working at minimum capacity. --philip
	addendum: I plan on merging main_login.php with project2.php.
		as it is right now, checklogin.php points to candidates.php, but it's not properly cycling through the pesudo pages you guys have created, so I'll try to fix that.

missed class today and don't have contact info for corey or stephanie, can anyone update with what's going on? --philip
